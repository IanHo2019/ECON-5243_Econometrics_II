# ECON-5243 Econometrics II
This repository includes Ian's solutions to ECON-5243 coding problem sets (2023 spring semester at The University of Oklahoma). OU PhD students should use this resource as a reference instead of an answer key or a cheat sheet. Comments on better coding or error correction are welcomed.

## Note on Stata Coding
In Stata, it's easy to install external packages: run `ssc install package, replace` where `package` should be replaced with the name of the package you want to install. For running my do files, the following packages may have to be installed: `estout`, `outreg2`, `asdoc`, all of which are useful in exporting regression results.

## Note on Data
The CRSP-Compustat Merged Database (CCM) used in Problem Set 4 is so large that I cannot upload to GitHub. You can download it from the [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) platform. For OU students, you can use my guideline ([here](./Appendix/How_to_Download_CCM.pdf)) if you are not familar with WRDS.
