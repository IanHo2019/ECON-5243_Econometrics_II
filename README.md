# ECON-5243-Econometrics-II
This repository includes Ian's solutions to ECON-5243 coding problem sets (2023 spring semester at The University of Oklahoma). OU PhD students should use this resource as a reference instead of an answer key or a cheat sheet. Comments on better coding or error correction are welcomed.

## Notice on Stata Coding
In Stata, it's easy to install external packages: run `ssc install package, replace` where `package` should be replaced with the name of the package you want to install. For running my do files, the following packages may have to be installed:
  * `estout`
  * `outreg2`
  * `asdoc`
